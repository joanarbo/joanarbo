You have components. You have governance.<br /><br />But you don't have visibility.<br /><br />One day you review 3 different products and find that the same component was implemented in 4 different ways in each one.<br /><br />And it happens silently. Without anyone seeing it as a problem.<br /><br />That is the reality of scaling a system in contexts with multiple autonomous teams.<br /><br /><strong>It's not chaos. It's invisibility.</strong><br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>🧩 The metrics dilemma</strong></h1><br />In complex financial contexts, the situation is more complicated than in other sectors.<br /><br />It's not just that you have multiple products: you have regulations, audits, compliance, and constant pressure for efficiency.<br /><br />A change in your design system isn't "fast and furious"; it's coordinated, measured, tracked.<br /><br />So, how do you measure if your system works?<br /><br />Here's the important part:<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>🎯 The trap of counting components</strong></h1><br />I've seen leaders say: "<em>We used 450 instances of our button last month.</em>"<br /><br />Sounds impressive.<br /><br />Means nothing.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />A button inside a header that appears on 30 pages: does it count as 1 or 30?<br /><br />A component copied and pasted in 15 places, does it count towards your system or count as 15 failures?<br /><br />More importantly: if you build 200 components but only 15 are seriously used...<br /><br /><strong>Do you really have a system or do you have a giant library that no one maintains?</strong><br /><br /><blockquote>The brutal truth is that most teams spend months measuring numbers that say nothing.</blockquote><br /><br />You need to change the approach.<br /><br /><strong>From "absolute frequency" to "breadth of use".</strong><br /><br />Not "how many instances of a component".<br /><br />But <strong>"how many different teams use this component."</strong><br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>📊 The minimum viable to start (and not overcomplicate)</strong></h1><br />First sprint (Week 1-2):<br /><br />Forget 50 charts. You need 4 metrics. Period.<br /><br />1️⃣ <strong>Visual coverage</strong>: What % of your interface uses DS components?<br /><br />2️⃣ <strong>Adoption by team</strong>: How many teams use the system?<br /><br />3️⃣ <strong>Consistency score</strong>: How many deviations are there per product?<br /><br />4️⃣ <strong>Time to component</strong>: How long do teams take to implement a new component?<br /><br /><strong>That. Is. It.</strong><br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>How to create your baseline in less than two hours:</strong></h1><br /><br />* <strong>Select 3 real products from your company.</strong><br /><br />* <strong>Count manually (yes, old school):</strong><br /><br /><em> Example: "</em>In the onboarding flow, 7 out of 10 screens use proper DS components.*"<br /><br />* That is your baseline: <strong>70% coverage in onboarding.</strong><br /><br />* Define a realistic 90-day goal, for example: <strong>raise it to 85%.</strong><br /><br />* <strong>Calculate your "consistency score":</strong><br /><br />* Choose 20 representative screens (pick 3-4 key flows: onboarding, transfers, payments...).<br /><br />* Visually review and note inconsistencies:<br /><br />* "This button has 12px padding here, 16px there."<br /><br />* "This input has a border, in the next one it doesn't."<br /><br />* If your DS covers only 65% in user signup, the remaining 35% is visual and functional debt that will grow with release.<br /><br />* <strong>Record every deviation (that is your initial score).</strong><br /><br /><strong>Trick to scale without going crazy:</strong><br /><br />* You can accelerate this process by automating part of the analysis:<br /><br />* Upload screenshots of those 20 screens to a folder.<br /><br />* Run a simple script (for example, in Cursor) or use a tool that detects visual or code-level inconsistencies.<br /><br />* In the end you will get something like:<br /><br />* "In these 20 screens I found X deviations. The most critical are: Button padding (8 times), Input border (6), Spacing in cards (4)."<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>🔥 The metric that nobody measures but should</strong></h1><br />Here comes what makes you shine:<br /><br />Every time a team detaches or customizes an existing component (instead of using it directly), they record it.<br /><br />Simple: a comment in Figma or a ticket.<br /><br />"We used Button but with custom border-radius because our use case is different."<br /><br />Now multiply.<br /><br /><strong>If 40 teams detach the Button in 5 different ways = same problem solved 40 times.</strong><br /><br />Translation: <strong>massive waste.</strong><br /><br />Wasted hours. Inconsistency in production. Accumulated technical debt.<br /><br />But here is the fascinating part.<br /><br />Every detach you record is pure insight.<br /><br /><strong>It's not an adoption failure.</strong><br /><br /><strong>It's a design failure.</strong><br /><br />Because now you know exactly where to iterate.<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>💡 The script that changes everything</strong></h1><br />Here is the final copy to explain code scanning (without Figma) and with your clear and technical tone:<br /><br /><strong>How to know how many teams really use your standard component and how many go rogue?</strong><br /><br />A simple script gives it to you in minutes.<br>It doesn't touch Figma or docs—only real code.<br /><br /><strong>Automatically scans the entire codebase:</strong><br>Looks for imports of the type:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><code>import { Button } from 'design-system';</code><br /></code></pre><br />Counts each import and groups it by folder, team, or context (you can map this to your monorepo or project naming).<br /><br /><strong>Detects "copies" and customizations:</strong><br>Locates components that are named the same but redefined locally, or that extend the original with styles, props, or duplicated code.<br>Example:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />import { Button } from 'design-system';<br /><br />// I create a variant for special cases<br />const DangerButton = (props) => (<br />  <Button {...props} color="red" /><br />);<br /></code></pre><br />Each case adds up as a "customized instance".<br /><br /><strong>It gives you a real report:</strong><br /><br /><pre><code><br />Onboarding Team: 11 standard imports, 2 custom <br />Accounts Team: 17 standard imports, 7 custom <br />Payments Team: 13 standard imports, 1 custom<br /></code></pre><br />So you see, without interpretation, which teams adopt the pattern 100% and which ones "break" it.<br /><br /><strong>You can extract extra info:</strong><br>The script also lists the props used, most frequent variants, or props suspicious of being a hack:<br /><br /><pre><code><br /><Button size="large" color="error" style={{borderRadius: 20}} /><br /></code></pre><br /><strong>What do you gain?</strong><br /><br />* Actionable data to know which components work and which invite custom.<br /><br />* Solid arguments to prioritize refactors ("this team always breaks it, let's talk to them").<br /><br />* A true view of the health and adoption of your Design System—the metric that really matters.<br /><br /><strong>Zero human effort after setup (2 hours max).</strong><br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>🧠 Adoption prediction before it fails</strong></h1><br />Here is where simple machine learning shines (and I don't say this as AI hype).<br /><br />The pattern is clear:<br /><br />If you see that similar components were detached 3+ times in the last 90 days...<br /><br />The new component you are going to launch <strong>will probably ALSO be detached.</strong><br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because there is an unresolved pattern in that component domain.<br /><br />So, before launching that new component, you can:<br /><br />* Automatically detect the historical detach pattern<br /><br />* Correlate it with the new component<br /><br />* <strong>Generate alerts</strong>: "This Button has 8 deviations in history. Your new component has similarities. Review these 3 use cases before launching."<br /><br /><blockquote>Basically, <strong>you predict if something is going to fail before it fails.</strong></blockquote><br /><br />The designer doesn't get frustrated. The component comes out better.<br /><br />Adoption goes up automatically because you solved the real problem.<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>📈 How this grows without breaking</strong></h1><br /><strong>Month 1:</strong> 50% coverage in 2 pilot products. Baseline feo but honest.<br /><br /><strong>Month 2:</strong> Leaders see the problem. Assign resources to improve rejected components.<br /><br /><strong>Month 3:</strong> Coverage goes up to 68%. Teams start asking for new components (good sign).<br /><br /><strong>Month 4-6:</strong> Scales to other products. Every new product that enters already starts at 65% coverage because they understand the pattern.<br /><br /><strong>Month 12:</strong> <strong>80% global coverage. System maintained by 2 people. Estimated annual savings: €200k-400k in design/dev hours.</strong><br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>❌ What NOT to do</strong></h1><br />Don't compare with other companies.<br /><br /><strong>Every bank is different. Every context is different. Every design system is different.</strong><br /><br />Here is where most fail:<br /><br />* Figma says the best practice is to have 80% reusable components.<br /><br />* Another bank has 6 designers and 50 components.<br /><br />* Design Systems Collective says you should have X metric.<br /><br />* Forgetting to ask teams why they detach components.<br /><br />* Measuring only frequency instead of understanding the pattern.<br /><br />* Comparing your system with banks that have different regulatory and business realities.<br /><br />Forget everything.<br /><br /><strong>Your Design System is subservient to the project, not the other way around.</strong><br /><br />Figma's rules are not yours.<br /><br />The best practices of another bank are not yours.<br /><br /><strong>Why?</strong><br /><br />* Because your context has specific regulations.<br /><br />* It has teams with dynamics that are not those of another bank.<br /><br />* It has code histories and decisions that another company never faced.<br /><br /><blockquote><strong>Invest in knowing your context.<br></strong><strong><em>A simple log of when and why a button is detached can save thousands of euros/month in support and QA.</strong></em></blockquote><br /><br />Then, design your metrics from there. Not from what others do.<br /><br /><strong><br>Common myths in banking DS metrics:</strong><br /><br />* "More components = more maturity". False. (I've seen banks with +200 components that don't achieve even 60% visual coherence.)<br /><br />* "Standard only matters in UX". False: in banking, the legal auditor uses your screens as evidence.<br /><br />* "Comparing with benchmarks from other companies". False, your context rules.<br /><br />#<br /><br />#<br /><br /><h1><strong>🚀 Your first move (next 7 days)</strong></h1><br /><br />* Take 1 product. Look at 3 complete flows.<br /><br />* Count: how many components are DS, how many are custom.<br /><br />* That % is your baseline.<br /><br />* Set a 90-day goal: +15%.<br /><br />* Meet with 2 teams. Ask: "What component would you need that doesn't exist? Which of our components is a problem?"<br /><br /><strong>That is enough to move the needle.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Key Takeaways / Actions for managers:</strong><br /><br /><em> </em>Measure teams, not just instances.*<br /><br /><em> </em>Record every custom, it is a strategic signal.*<br /><br /><em> </em>Ask teams why they adapt.*<br /><br /><em> </em>Adjust the score regularly: banking products evolve every quarter.*<br /><br /><blockquote><strong><em>If you want your team or your manager to see the impact, print this checklist and use it next quarter.</strong></em></blockquote><br /><br /><strong>To dig deeper:</strong><br /><br />* <strong>Automated audits in Design Systems:</strong><br><strong>[Design System Metrics: From Adoption to Impact (by Zeroheight & DS expert Nathan Curtis)](https://blog.zeroheight.com/design-system-metrics-adoption-impact/)</strong><br /><br />* <strong>How to analyze real breadth of use with code:</strong><br><strong>[Measure Adoption of a Design System with Automated Scripts (Medium, Ryan Clark)](https://uxdesign.cc/measuring-adoption-of-a-design-system-32293ffb351c)</strong><br /><br />* <strong>Real metrics and tooling for Product Managers:</strong><br><strong>[Product Metrics: Find the North Star (by Intercom)](https://www.intercom.com/blog/product-metrics-north-star/)</strong><br /><br />* <strong>How to detect "custom forks" in component libraries:</strong><br><strong>[Detecting UI Consistency and Component Forks in Large Codebases (by Engineering @Airbnb)](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/design-system-science-cc0dc49dec10)</strong><br /><br />* <strong>Advanced governance guide for complex environments:</strong><br><strong>[Governance of Design Systems in Large Organizations (by Sparkbox)](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/design_systems_governance_perspectives)</strong><br /><br /><strong>What would be the savings in hours (or reduction of technical debt) if you could visualize all the customizations that are hidden today?</strong><br /><br />#DesignSystems #Banking #ProductLeadership #Metrics #Efficiency</div></div><div style="margin-top:4rem;padding-top:2rem;border-top:1px solid var(--line-color);text-align:center;display:flex;flex-direction:column;align-items:center;gap:1rem"><p style="font-family:var(--font-mono);font-size:0.9rem;color:var(--text-secondary-color)">Enjoyed this read?</p><a class="btn-primary" style="display:inline-flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;padding:12px 24px;background:var(--text-color);color:var(--bg-color);border-radius:4px;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.9rem;font-family:var(--font-mono);text-transform:uppercase;letter-spacing:0.05em" href="#contact">Contact</a></div></div></article><!--$--><!--/$--><button class="scroll-to-top" aria-label="Scroll to top"><i class="ph-thin ph-arrow-up"></i></button><footer class="footer"><div class="container footer-content"><p>© 2026 Joan Arbo · AI Systems Architect</p><p>Architected with Cursor AI · Systems over fluff</p></div></footer><script src="/_next/static/chunks/a0876a5cb8876163.js" id="_R_" async=""></script><script>(self.__next_f=self.__next_f||[]).push([0])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"1:\"$Sreact.fragment\"\n2:I[30824,[\"/_next/static/chunks/fcd5ca7eccc4157c.js\"],\"Providers\"]\n4:I[79520,[\"/_next/static/chunks/fcd5ca7eccc4157c.js\"],\"\"]\n5:I[3374,[\"/_next/static/chunks/fcd5ca7eccc4157c.js\"],\"Header\"]\n6:I[39756,[\"/_next/static/chunks/ff1a16fafef87110.js\",\"/_next/static/chunks/d2be314c3ece3fbe.js\"],\"default\"]\n7:I[37457,[\"/_next/static/chunks/ff1a16fafef87110.js\",\"/_next/static/chunks/d2be314c3ece3fbe.js\"],\"default\"]\n8:I[48126,[\"/_next/static/chunks/fcd5ca7eccc4157c.js\"],\"ScrollToTop\"]\n9:I[58234,[\"/_next/static/chunks/fcd5ca7eccc4157c.js\"],\"Footer\"]\nd:I[68027,[],\"default\"]\n:HL[\"/_next/static/chunks/4a61e79bf812c68e.css\",\"style\"]\n:HL[\"/_next/static/media/2a65768255d6b625-s.p.d19752fb.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n:HL[\"/_next/static/media/70bc3e132a0a741e-s.p.15008bfb.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n:HL[\"/_next/static/media/83afe278b6a6bb3c-s.p.3a6ba036.woff2\",\"font\",{\"crossOrigin\":\"\",\"type\":\"font/woff2\"}]\n3:T598,"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@graph\":[{\"@type\":\"Person\",\"@id\":\"https://joanarbo.com/#person\",\"name\":\"Joan Arbo\",\"url\":\"https://joanarbo.com\",\"jobTitle\":\"Design Systems Lead \u0026 Strategist\",\"description\":\"Operational Strategy Lead bridging design and engineering.
