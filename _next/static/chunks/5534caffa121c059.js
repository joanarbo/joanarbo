It\'s the moment of maximum velocity. Maximum intensity. Afterward, it drifts away. But that instant - that single instant - contains all the accumulated energy of the journey.\\n\\nJiro Ono, the legendary sushi master, spends 70 years searching for his perihelion.\\n\\nHe doesn\'t call it that. He calls it perfection. Purity. But it\'s the same thing: that point where everything converges. Where detail, repetition, and the silence of decades of craftsmanship condense into a single gesture.\\n\\nA grain of rice. A knife movement. Nothing more.\\n\\nEverything.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# I. Orbit: Understanding the Creative Process\\n*[0:00 - 1:30: The introduction. Soft strings, almost inaudible.]*\\n\\nWhen you design, code, create - you\'re in orbit.\\n\\nSome days far from the center. Scattered. Jumping between tasks, tools, notifications. Distance protects you. It doesn\'t burn. But you don\'t move forward either.\\n\\nOther days, closer. Hours disappear. You forget to eat. Code flows. Design breathes. You don\'t think about what you\'re doing; you simply do it.\\n\\nIt\'s flow state. That state where the brain releases conscious control and lets specialized neural networks - trained over years - work alone. Without supervision. Without friction.\\n\\nBut there\'s an even deeper point.\\n\\nPerihelion.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# II. Approach: The Path to Mastery\\n*[1:30 - 3:00: Piano enters. Strings begin to tense.]*\\n\\nCharles Eames said: \\"The details are not just details. They make the design.\\"\\n\\nHe wasn\'t talking about ornament. He was talking about essence.\\n\\nThat place where if you remove something, everything collapses. If you add something, everything becomes contaminated.\\n\\nIt\'s the closest point to truth.\\n\\nAnd to get there, you can\'t rush. You have to orbit. Again and again. Observe. Iterate. Repeat the same movement 10,000 times until the pattern emerges.\\n\\nJiro didn\'t invent sushi. He eliminated everything that wasn\'t sushi.\\n\\nThat\'s the difference.\\n\\nWe add: variants, use cases, exceptions, flexibility.\\n\\nWe call it \\"coverage.\\"\\n\\nBut mastery is the opposite. It\'s subtraction. It\'s saying: this, and only this, is necessary.\\n\\nAnd when you finally arrive - when you touch that point - everything else reveals itself as obvious.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# III. The Problem: AI and the Fragmentation of Deep Work\\n*[3:00 - 4:30: Tension grows. Violin, viola. Layers accumulating.]*\\n\\nBut now something has changed.\\n\\nAI is here. Cursor, Figma, generative models whispering at every pause.\\n\\nAnd for the first time in years, it\'s difficult to reach perihelion.\\n\\nBecause perihelion requires sustained velocity in one direction. Continuous hours. Total immersion. That deceleration of the external world that allows internal acceleration.\\n\\nBut AI interrupts.\\n\\nNot violently. With suggestions. With shortcuts. With the seductive promise that you can get there faster.\\n\\nAnd technically, it\'s true. You can generate more. More components. More code. More variations.\\n\\nBut more isn\'t perihelion.\\n\\nPerihelion is the point of maximum closeness, not maximum production.\\n\\nIt\'s being so close to the essence that there\'s no distance between you and what you create.\\n\\nAnd that can\'t be accelerated.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# IV. Broken Orbits: Losing Flow in the Age of AI\\n*[4:30 - 5:45: The climax begins to build. Everything converges.]*\\n\\nI\'ve noticed something.\\n\\nMy best work - the work that truly IS something - was born in long sessions. Uninterrupted. No AI. No Slack. No browser.\\n\\nJust me, the problem, and hours evaporating.\\n\\nThat state where the prefrontal cortex shuts down and creative networks work alone. Where you don\'t supervise your own thinking; it simply flows.\\n\\nTransient hypofrontality, neuroscientists call it. The brain releasing control to allow what it already knows but can\'t verbalize to emerge.\\n\\nAI doesn\'t enter there.\\n\\nNot because it\'s incapable. Because it\'s a dialogue. And dialogue keeps you in the prefrontal cortex—supervising, evaluating, adjusting.\\n\\nNever letting go.\\n\\nNever reaching perihelion.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# V. The Decision: Protecting Deep Work and Flow State\\n*[5:45 - 7:00: The crescendo. Strings at their peak.]*\\n\\nAI isn\'t the enemy.\\n\\nIt\'s a tool for the outer orbit. For the superficial. For what scales.\\n\\nBut perihelion - that point of maximum closeness to what\'s true - remains human.\\n\\nIt remains slow.\\n\\nIt remains boring, sometimes.\\n\\nAnd it requires something radical in a world of speed: protecting the long hours. The sessions where you disappear. Where a detail consumes your entire day and at the end - only at the end - you see that detail was everything.\\n\\nTurn off notifications.\\n\\nClose Cursor.\\n\\nLet the code, the design, the problem look back at you for hours.\\n\\nUntil you reach the point where there\'s no distance.\\n\\nWhere you are the work.\\n\\nWhere you touch perihelion.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# VI. The Journey: Embracing the Orbit\\n*[7:00 - 7:48: The resolution. Everything settles. Silence that breathes.]*\\n\\nJiro, after 70 years, says: \\"No one knows where the top is.\\"\\n\\nHe hasn\'t arrived.\\n\\nPerhaps he never will.\\n\\nBut each day he gets closer. Each movement. Each repetition. Each minimal refinement that no one else notices.\\n\\nThat\'s the orbit.\\n\\nAnd perihelion isn\'t a destination. It\'s an instant. Fleeting. Intense. True.\\n\\nAnd then you drift away again.\\n\\nBut you know it existed. That you touched it.\\n\\nAnd that changes everything.\\n\\nThe essence is there. Underneath. Always.\\n\\nYou just have to get close enough to feel it.\\n\\nBut first, you have to let go of control.\\n\\nDisconnect.\\n\\nAnd let the orbit carry you.\\n\\nWhen was the last time you reached your perihelion?

Is. It.**\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **How to create your baseline in less than two hours:**\\n\\n* **Select 3 real products from your company.**\\n\\n* **Count manually (yes, old school):**\\n\\n* Example: \\"*In the onboarding flow, 7 out of 10 screens use proper DS components.*\\"\\n\\n* That is your baseline: **70% coverage in onboarding.**\\n\\n* Define a realistic 90-day goal, for example: **raise it to 85%.**\\n\\n* **Calculate your \\"consistency score\\":**\\n\\n* Choose 20 representative screens (pick 3-4 key flows: onboarding, transfers, payments...).\\n\\n* Visually review and note inconsistencies:\\n\\n* \\"This button has 12px padding here, 16px there.\\"\\n\\n* \\"This input has a border, in the next one it doesn\'t.\\"\\n\\n* If your DS covers only 65% in user signup, the remaining 35% is visual and functional debt that will grow with release.\\n\\n* **Record every deviation (that is your initial score).**\\n\\n**Trick to scale without going crazy:**\\n\\n* You can accelerate this process by automating part of the analysis:\\n\\n* Upload screenshots of those 20 screens to a folder.\\n\\n* Run a simple script (for example, in Cursor) or use a tool that detects visual or code-level inconsistencies.\\n\\n* In the end you will get something like:\\n\\n* \\"In these 20 screens I found X deviations. The most critical are: Button padding (8 times), Input border (6), Spacing in cards (4).\\"\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **🔥 The metric that nobody measures but should**\\nHere comes what makes you shine:\\n\\nEvery time a team detaches or customizes an existing component (instead of using it directly), they record it.\\n\\nSimple: a comment in Figma or a ticket.\\n\\n\\"We used Button but with custom border-radius because our use case is different.\\"\\n\\nNow multiply.\\n\\n**If 40 teams detach the Button in 5 different ways = same problem solved 40 times.**\\n\\nTranslation: **massive waste.**\\n\\nWasted hours. Inconsistency in production. Accumulated technical debt.\\n\\nBut here is the fascinating part.\\n\\nEvery detach you record is pure insight.\\n\\n**It\'s not an adoption failure.**\\n\\n**It\'s a design failure.**\\n\\nBecause now you know exactly where to iterate.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **💡 The script that changes everything**\\nHere is the final copy to explain code scanning (without Figma) and with your clear and technical tone:\\n\\n**How to know how many teams really use your standard component and how many go rogue?**\\n\\nA simple script gives it to you in minutes.<br>It doesn\'t touch Figma or docs—only real code.\\n\\n**Automatically scans the entire codebase:**<br>Looks for imports of the type:\\n\\n```\\n<code>import { Button } from \'design-system\';</code>\\n```\\nCounts each import and groups it by folder, team, or context (you can map this to your monorepo or project naming).\\n\\n**Detects \\"copies\\" and customizations:**<br>Locates components that are named the same but redefined locally, or that extend the original with styles, props, or duplicated code.<br>Example:\\n\\n```\\nimport { Button } from \'design-system\';\\n\\n// I create a variant for special cases\\nconst DangerButton = (props) => (\\n  <Button {...props} color=\\"red\\" />\\n);\\n```\\nEach case adds up as a \\"customized instance\\".\\n\\n**It gives you a real report:**\\n\\n```\\nOnboarding Team: 11 standard imports, 2 custom \\nAccounts Team: 17 standard imports, 7 custom \\nPayments Team: 13 standard imports, 1 custom\\n```\\nSo you see, without interpretation, which teams adopt the pattern 100% and which ones \\"break\\" it.\\n\\n**You can extract extra info:**<br>The script also lists the props used, most frequent variants, or props suspicious of being a hack:\\n\\n```\\n<Button size=\\"large\\" color=\\"error\\" style={{borderRadius: 20}} />\\n```\\n**What do you gain?**\\n\\n* Actionable data to know which components work and which invite custom.\\n\\n* Solid arguments to prioritize refactors (\\"this team always breaks it, let\'s talk to them\\").\\n\\n* A true view of the health and adoption of your Design System—the metric that really matters.\\n\\n**Zero human effort after setup (2 hours max).**\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **🧠 Adoption prediction before it fails**\\nHere is where simple machine learning shines (and I don\'t say this as AI hype).\\n\\nThe pattern is clear:\\n\\nIf you see that similar components were detached 3+ times in the last 90 days...\\n\\nThe new component you are going to launch **will probably ALSO be detached.**\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause there is an unresolved pattern in that component domain.\\n\\nSo, before launching that new component, you can:\\n\\n* Automatically detect the historical detach pattern\\n\\n* Correlate it with the new component\\n\\n* **Generate alerts**: \\"This Button has 8 deviations in history. Your new component has similarities. Review these 3 use cases before launching.\\"\\n\\n> Basically, **you predict if something is going to fail before it fails.**\\n\\nThe designer doesn\'t get frustrated. The component comes out better.\\n\\nAdoption goes up automatically because you solved the real problem.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **📈 How this grows without breaking**\\n**Month 1:** 50% coverage in 2 pilot products. Baseline feo but honest.\\n\\n**Month 2:** Leaders see the problem. Assign resources to improve rejected components.\\n\\n**Month 3:** Coverage goes up to 68%. Teams start asking for new components (good sign).\\n\\n**Month 4-6:** Scales to other products.

What becomes of the UI when the agent is the user?","content":"Let me tell you a story in two parts.\\n\\nThe first is complex, but it marks the before and after (and explains why **I\'m still hooked on this dilemma**).\\n\\nThe second is practical: **how you can take advantage of it today**.\\n\\n<h2>**PART 1: Alexa Shopping and the dilemma of layers**</h2>When I worked at Amazon Alexa Shopping, months before the ChatGPT hype, I became obsessed with one question:\\n\\n**How do you design a shopping system that works equally well on voice, screens, wearables and multiple languages without having to rebuild everything every time?**\\n\\n> I spent 6 months thinking about this. There were no references, gurus or literature on \\"**Multimodal Design Systems applied to shopping**\\".\\n\\nInstead of linear flows (search -> view product -> add to cart -> pay), I proposed something different: grouping moments in time.\\n\\nNo single paths. Multi-path.\\n\\nBut here\'s the technical part that had me obsessed:\\n\\n**Each \\"moment\\" was not a fixed component of the Design System. It was a group of information that auto-generated into a multimodal component on the fly.**\\n\\nLet me explain this because it\'s the core of everything:\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **The auto-generated multimodal component**\\nIn a traditional Design System you have:\\n\\n* A button\\n\\n* A product card\\n\\n* A payment form\\n\\nThey are **pre-designed and static** components.\\n\\nIn a multimodal system, you have **information groups** that turn into components according to context:\\n\\n**Information group: \\"Confirmation of purchase of AA batteries\\"**\\n\\nContains:\\n\\n* Product name\\n\\n* Price\\n\\n* Saved payment method\\n\\n* Shipping address\\n\\n* Estimated delivery date\\n\\n**And this group self-renders as:**\\n\\n🔲 **On Echo Show (visual + voice):**\\n\\n-> Card with product image\\n\\n-> \\"1-Click Buy\\" button\\n\\n-> Voice: \\"Should I confirm your order for Duracell batteries for €8.99?\\"\\n\\n🗣️ **On Echo Dot (voice only + light):**\\n\\n-> No visual\\n\\n-> Voice: \\"Duracell AA batteries, €8.99, arriving tomorrow. Say \'confirm\' or \'cancel\'\\"\\n\\n-> Pulsing blue LED ring (waiting for response) -> green (confirmed) -> red (cancelled)\\n\\n👆 **In mobile app (visual + touch):**\\n\\n-> Expandable card with full details\\n\\n-> Large \\"Confirm purchase\\" button\\n\\n-> Swipe up for more options\\n\\n📱 **On smartwatch (minimal notification):**\\n\\n-> \\"Your usual battery order - €8.99\\"\\n\\n-> Two buttons: ✓ and ✗\\n\\n-> Vibration on confirmation\\n\\n🤖 **In AI agent (API only):**\\n\\n-> No visual or voice\\n\\n-> Consume endpoint: <code>POST /orders/confirm</code>\\n\\n-> Receive: <code>{orderId, status, estimatedDelivery}</code>\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **And here\'s the magic:**\\n**The same group of information generates 5 different components automatically.**\\n\\nYou don\'t build 5 separate components.\\n\\nYou build **a system that knows what to render based on the device**.\\n\\nThe best part is that:\\n\\n**When the user changes device mid-flow, the component regenerates in the new context without losing state.**\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# Real example (beyond typical cross-device):\\nSuppose that not only the flow is resumed between devices, but the component reconfigures itself in real time according to the \\"information group\\" and the channel in which it appears.\\n\\n* User is cooking and asks Alexa by voice: \\"Is there any oil left?\\"\\n\\n* Alexa responds by voice: \\"There\'s little left. You can order your favorite.\\"\\n\\n* Alexa activates the \\"recurring order\\" component in voice-only mode, asking: \\"Should I order it for today?\\"\\n\\n* User responds with a gesture (moving their hand close to Alexa):\\n\\n* The system translates that gesture as \\"yes, order oil\\" because the light pattern and distance are configured for that action.\\n\\n* Without human intervention, the system groups all relevant info (product, address, payment method, history) into a base object that can be interpreted in any context.\\n\\n* The user, already out of the house, opens the Amazon mobile app:\\n\\n* The system detects the channel change and **instantly generates a touch component**, with a \\"Cancel order\\" button, brand change options, and a summary notification.\\n\\n* All state, options, and flow context are maintained, but **the component is not the same as in Alexa: it automatically adapts to the touch and visual capabilities of the device**.\\n\\nThe system understands that there is no \\"button to order oil\\", but **the essence of the order**, which can take shape as a voice phrase, onscreen option, wearable vibration, or an AI agent API request.\\n\\nThus each \\"moment\\" of the experience is **multimodal and adaptable**, not just cross-device.\\n\\n> **Same flow. Multiple devices. One single system.**\\n\\nAnd this was possible because each multimodal component had these layers:\\n\\n🔲 **Visual layer:** 2D components of traditional DS (cards, buttons, forms)\\n\\n🗣️ **Conversational layer:** voice text fragments\\n\\n👆 **Input layer:** interaction rules (touch, voice, gestures, distance sensors)\\n\\n🔌 **Data layer:** API with the information group\\n\\n🧭 **Navigation layer:** transition rules (where you come from, where you\'re going)\\n\\nDepending on the device, the system activated the necessary layers **and generated the component on the fly**.\\n\\nIn 2022, this sounded abstract.\\n\\nBecause that doesn\'t scale when you have 15 different Alexa device types, plus mobile app, plus web, plus wearables.\\n\\nIn 2025, with AI agents buying alone...\\n\\n<h2>**PART 2: Why this matters and how to take advantage of it now**</h2>What changed this week:\\n\\nAI agents are now buying by themselves.<br><br>**You ask an assistant: *****\\"Hire 10 creators for my campaign\\"*****.**\\n\\n**The agent searches, compares, pays the $50 with your prior permission, and delivers results.**\\n\\nNo app. No checkout. No forms.\\n\\n**The AI agent is just another \\"device\\", even if it acts without visual or voice. Just business logic.**\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **The data that backs it up**\\nThis is not science fiction. The numbers are clear:\\n\\n📊 **$1.7 trillion** in AI-driven commerce projected for 2030 (Edgar Dunn & Co.)\\n\\n📊 **25% of online sales** will be performed by AI agents by then (PayPal CEO)\\n\\n📊 **1M+ merchants** on Shopify already enabled to sell through conversational agents\\n\\n📊 **58% of financial institutions** attribute revenue growth to IA (McKinsey)\\n\\n**In Alexa Shopping in 2022, this was an experiment.**\\n\\n> **In 2025, with agents buying alone, it\'s the next wave.**\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **The case that makes it tangible: when Stripe understood the game**\\nStripe exemplifies it perfectly:\\n\\nA single API and context, infinite uses.<br>Not manual integrations but rules, tokens and components that adapt to each channel.<br>If you need a new component for each context, you fall behind.<br>If you define the information groups well, the system self-generates and scales alone.\\n\\n**How to start building for this future (without rewriting everything)**\\n\\nThe good news: you don\'t need to throw away your current system.\\n\\n<h2>**How to start?**</h2>You can start applying these principles step by step:\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **1. Stop thinking about fixed components. Start thinking about information groups.**\\nInstead of designing \\"a product card\\", ask yourself:\\n\\nWhat critical information do I need to show at this moment?\\n\\n(Name, price, availability, payment method...)\\n\\nThen define how that information renders according to context:\\n\\n* **Visual:** card + button\\n\\n* **Voice:** phrase + confirmation\\n\\n* **API:** JSON with the same data\\n\\n* **Wearable:** minimal notification\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **2. Separate data from presentation.**\\nYour \\"information group\\" should live in an independent data layer.\\n\\nThe presentation layer decides how to show it according to the device.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **3. Make your components capable of continuing across multiple devices.**\\nThe flow state should not live in the visual component.\\n\\nIt should live in a navigation layer that persists between devices.\\n\\nExample: user starts on voice, continues in app, ends in web.\\n\\n**Same flow. Multiple contexts.**\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **4. Turn manual processes into automatic rendering rules.**\\nInstead of manually creating variants for each context, define rules:\\n\\n\\"If device = Alexa Dot -> voice only\\"\\n\\n\\"If device = Echo Show -> voice + visual\\"\\n\\n\\"If device = AI agent -> API only\\"\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **5. Make traceability automatic, not optional.**\\nEach auto-generated component must record:\\n\\n* What information did it contain?\\n\\n* In what device was it rendered?\\n\\n* What layers were activated?\\n\\n* How did the user respond?\\n\\nAll auditable. Always.\\n\\n**Why I\'m so excited about this**\\n\\n3 years ago, at Alexa Shopping, I started exploring multimodal components for purchases.

The city. Illinois. United States. The Earth. The solar system. The galaxy. The observable universe.\\n\\n*We reached 10²⁴ meters. The edge of everything known.*\\n\\nThen it returns. To the picnic. And continues inward.\\n\\nTo the man\'s hand. To the skin. To the cells. To the molecules. To the atoms. To the quarks.\\n\\n*Down to 10^-16 meters.

Five experiences. Three devices. All coherent.***\\n\\nIt was design at ecosystem scale. Thinking about how complex systems work together. The view from 10^24 meters.\\n\\nBut that night, after Laura\'s question, I realized something unsettling:\\n\\nWhat happens when you go down 40 orders of magnitude? What is the minimum unit of a design system? The minimum expression that can encode meaning?\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# The experiment: wedding invitations from the emotional atom\\nI decided to apply \\"**Powers of Ten**\\" to the most empathetic case I could think of: digital wedding invitations.\\n\\nThe traditional scale (view from 10 meters):\\n\\nI had 73 templates in Figma:\\n\\n* \\"Romantic\\" Template #1\\n\\n* \\"Modern\\" Template #2\\n\\n* \\"Classic\\" Template #3\\n\\nThe process was the usual: couple chooses template, I change colors, adjust names and date, send. *Rinse and repeat.*\\n\\nIt\'s the \\"human\\" scale of design. Where we all normally operate.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# But what if I go down to atomic scale?\\nInstead of showing templates, I asked Laura (yes, my student) and her partner:\\n\\n*\\"How do you want your guests to feel when they receive the invitation?\\"*\\n\\nLaura and her partner: *\\"Intimate, warm, familiar\\"*\\n\\nI didn\'t look for *\\"Romantic Template #3\\"*.\\n\\n**I went down to the minimum expression. To the emotional tokens of the invitation:**\\n\\n```\\n$invitation-intimacy: (\\n. spacing: generous, // breathes, doesn\'t overwhelm\\n. palette: warm-earth, // terracotta, cream, sage\\n. typography: gentle, // soft serif, not imposing\\n. decoration: minimal. // discreet flowers, not pompous\\n);\\n```\\n**It\'s like in the Eames film:** when you go down to molecular scale, you discover that what seemed solid (a wedding template) is actually made of atoms (minimal emotional decisions).\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# The two scales in action: Alexa vs wedding invitations\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **Macro Scale (my project at Alexa — 2 years):**\\n**User: Alexa, I want a romantic atmosphere\\"**\\n\\nSystem orchestrates multiple devices:\\n\\n* Lights → warm amber, 30% intensity\\n\\n* Music → smooth jazz, low volume\\n\\n* Screen → fireplace animation\\n\\n* Temperature → goes up 2 degrees\\n\\nOne instruction. Four systems. All synchronized.\\n\\nView from the universe: how complex experiences work together.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **Micro Scale (wedding invitations — the new approach):**\\nBut what makes \\"warm amber\\" feel romantic and not \\"bright white\\"?\\n\\nThere\'s the atom. The same principle applied to a wedding invitation:\\n\\n```\\n// Alexa\'s \\"romantic atom\\"\\n$romantic-light: (\\n. hue: 30, // warm orange\\n. saturation: 85, // rich but not saturated\\n. brightness: 30. // intimate, not bright\\n);\\n\\n// The same \\"romantic atom\\" in an invitation\\n$invitation-warmth: (\\n. color-primary: hsl(30, 85%, 30%), // same hue\\n. color-accent: hsl(30, 75%, 85%), // soft version\\n. color-background: hsl(30, 25%, 95%) // almost warm white\\n);\\n```\\n**⚠️ The insight:** For Alexa to work at universe scale, someone had to design first at atom scale. Same with wedding invitations.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# When the atom defines the universe: real case\\nAna and Marcos respond differently: \\"Vibrant, international, celebration\\"\\n\\n**Micro Scale (the tokens of their invitation):**\\n\\n```\\n$invitation-celebration: (\\n. spacing: dynamic, // overlapping elements\\n. palette: festive-bold, // electric blue + gold\\n. typography: geometric, // architectural sans-serif\\n. decoration: maximal. // festive ornamentation\\n);\\n```\\n**Macro Scale (their entire digital wedding experience):**\\n\\nFrom those atoms, the system automatically generates:\\n\\n* Save the date (first contact)<br>Uses tokens: dynamic spacing, festive palette<br>Mood: \\"something big is coming\\"\\n\\n* Main invitation (core experience)<br>Same tokens, more complex hierarchy<br>Mood: \\"international celebration\\"\\n\\n* RSVP card (interaction)<br>Tokens applied to form<br>Mood: \\"respond with energy\\"\\n\\n* Thank you notes (farewell)<br>Softer but recognizable tokens<br>Mood: \\"thanks for celebrating with us\\"\\n\\n> All coherent.

It is thinking in both scales simultaneously.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# The connection between Alexa and a wedding invitation\\nThis is how it works in both cases:\\n\\n**Micro Scale (10^-16): A color token**\\n\\n```\\n// In Alexa\\n$ambient-romantic: hsl(30, 85%, 30%);\\n\\n// In wedding invitation\\n$invitation-warmth: hsl(30, 85%, 30%);\\n```\\n**Molecular Scale (10^-8): A component**\\n\\n```\\n// In Alexa\\n<LightControl mood=\\"romantic\\" />\\n\\n// In invitation\\n<Card emotional-tone=\\"intimate\\" />\\n```\\n**Cellular Scale (10^0): A complete scene**\\n\\n```\\n// In Alexa\\n<RomanticAmbience room=\\"living\\" />\\n\\n// In invitation\\n<WeddingInvitation couple=\\"Laura-Pablo\\" />\\n```\\n**Ecosystem Scale (10^8): A complete experience**\\n\\n```\\n// In Alexa (multi-device)\\n<SmartHomeExperience mood=\\"romantic\\" />\\n\\n// In wedding (multi-format)\\n<WeddingExperience theme=\\"intimate-celebration\\" />\\n```\\n**Each scale builds on the previous one. But without the right atoms at 10^-16, the entire universe at 10^24 feels generic.**\\n\\nWhether it\'s Alexa orchestrating your home or a wedding invitation arriving on your WhatsApp.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# What\'s coming: the bidirectional designer\\nI\'m developing a methodology that operates in both directions:\\n\\n**When you go up (macro):**\\n\\n* From wedding tokens → save the date → invitation → complete experience\\n\\n* Like building a celebration from its emotional atoms\\n\\n**When you go down (micro):**\\n\\n* From \\"I want an intimate wedding\\" → what palette? → what tokens define intimacy?\\n\\n* Like understanding why an invitation feels a certain way\\n\\n> The power: Emotional coherence from the quark to the universe.\\n\\nWhether in Alexa multimodal or in digital wedding invitations.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# **Your turn:**\\nOn what scale do you normally design?\\n\\nHave you thought about macro experiences (like Alexa, ecosystems)?\\n\\nHave you gone down to micro scale (tokens that feel) in your projects?\\n\\nWhat would you discover if you changed your scale 10x up or 10x down?\\n\\n**Exercise for today:**\\n\\n**Take your last project.

La Sophie finalment podia veure el que veia l\'Henrik. Els nostres enginyers podien depurar casos límit de GDPR sense jugar a les 20 preguntes amb atenció al client. **Els nostres tiquets de suport per problemes de checkout van caure un 41%.**\\n\\nPerò la lliçó més gran va ser sobre per a qui havíem estat construint. L\'Emma és real, però també és fàcil. Té fibra òptica, compatibilitat SEPA, i viu on tot arriba ràpid. Construir per a l\'Emma se sent com un progrés perquè tot funciona.\\n\\nL\'Henrik és real també, però és inconvenient. Les seves limitacions exposen cada suposició que hem fet sobre com haurien de funcionar les compres a Europa. Construir per a l\'Henrik se sent com resoldre problemes perquè res està garantit en 27 estats membres.\\n\\nEl checkout preciós, optimitzat per a l\'Emma, que es veia tan bé a les demos era en realitat un mur que deixava fora l\'Henrik. La nostra documentació ens havia ajudat a construir aquell mur fent-lo invisible.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# La Imatge Completa: Quan el Perfecte es Converteix en Enemic del Bo\\n**Això no es tracta només d\'e-commerce o APIs. Es tracta d\'una trampa de gestió comuna: optimitzar per al client ideal mentre ignores els reals.**\\n\\nCada negoci té una Emma — el client que fa que les teves mètriques es vegin genial i les teves demos cantin. Cada negoci també té un Henrik — el client que revela on es trenca realment el teu producte a través de la complexitat del mercat europeu.\\n\\nLa majoria d\'equips construeixen documentació com si escrivissin el manual de propietari per a un cotxe que només condueix en autobahns alemanyes perfectes. Documenten el camí feliç perquè és net, predictible i fa que tothom se senti competent.\\n\\nPerò els teus clients no viuen en carreteres perfectes. Viuen a la Lapònia de l\'Henrik, on internet és lent i els bancs tenen regles diferents. Treballen al Lió del Marcel, on res és simple i tot necessita aprovació sota la llei comercial francesa.\\n\\n#\\n\\n#\\n\\n# Tres Preguntes Que van Canviar Com Construïm\\nAbans de llançar res ara, preguntem:\\n\\n**Funciona això per a l\'Henrik?** No en teoria — en la pràctica, amb la seva connexió lenta i requisits bancaris nòrdics estrictes.\\n\\n**Pot la Sophie provar l\'escenari de l\'Henrik ella mateixa?** Sense agendar una immersió profunda d\'enginyeria o esperar que el compliment de GDPR funcioni.\\n\\n**Com es veu realment la falla?** No el missatge d\'error sanitat, sinó l\'experiència d\'usuari frustrada a través de diferents regulacions de la UE.\\n\\nAquestes preguntes van canviar com pensem sobre tot, des d\'especificacions de features fins a copy de màrqueting. L\'Emma ens mostra el que és possible. L\'Henrik ens mostra el que és necessari a través del Mercat Únic Europeu.\\n\\nEl dia que la nostra documentació va començar a dir la veritat sobre l\'Henrik va ser el dia que vam deixar de construir per al client que desitjàvem tenir i vam començar a construir per als clients que realment servim en 27 entorns regulatoris diferents.\\n\\nAquí va ser quan el nostre prototip perfecte va deixar de mentir i va començar a funcionar.\\n\\n> La teva documentació no és només un manual d\'instruccions — és un mirall. Assegura\'t que està reflectint la realitat correcta a través de tots els teus mercats.\\n\\n*Més per venir...*\\n\\n*Indagaré en l\'evolució de la nostra API i els seus efectes dominó en com pensem sobre els sistemes de disseny.*\\n\\n*Vols la resta de la història?

Dejo que la IA m\'entrevisti en funció del que he omplert a la targeta.<br>** En comptes de barallar-me amb el full en blanc, li demano a la IA que em desafii — *\\"On està el veritable problema?
